> Mail with Notmuch Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vhdirk/inox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vhdirk/inox)

An experimental email client based on notmuch, along with other utilities like
afew and offlineimap.

A lot of inspiration comes from [Astroid](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid),
but I do want some more UI.


## Goals
I'm aiming for a nice and full-featured UI, but it should be fully operable with the keyboard.  
All settings should be stored in easily readable/editable config files, so you
can centralize them in your dotfiles.
While Astroid relies on an external editor for writing emails, I aim for a
default embedded editor. I do like the option of using the editor of your liking, though.
